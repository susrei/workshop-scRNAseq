We do accept application from other countries, but priority is given to applicants from Swedish universities prior to applicants from industry and academics from other countries.\n\nPlease note that NBIS training events do not provide any formal university credits. The training content is estimated to correspond to a certain number of credits, however the estimated credits are just guidelines. If formal credits are crucial, the student needs to confer with the home department before submitting a workshop application in order to establish whether the workshop is valid for formal credits or not.\n\nWe cannot invoice private individuals, therefore an affiliation is required.\n\n\n\nPractical exercises can be performed using R or Python, so we only accept students with previous experience in one of those programming languages.\n\nBasic knowledge in R/Python and command line (bash).\nBe able to use your own computer with R or Python installed for the practical computational exercises. Instructions on installation will be sent by email to accepted participants.\nProgramming/scripting experience is required (in R or python).\nBasic understanding of NGS technologies and RNA-sequencing data.\nDesirable: Previous experience with RNA-seq analysis and/or participation in NGS/RNA-seq workshop is an advantage.\n\nDue to limited space the workshop can accommodate maximum of 25 participants. If we receive more applications, participants will be selected based on several criteria. Selection criteria include correct entry requirements, motivation to attend the workshop as well as gender and geographical balance."

If you did not register yet, please follow the precourse information and send an email to serve@scilifelab.se and let them know that you completed the registration.\n\n\n\nSelect My projects from the main menu. You should see a project called SCRNASEQ_VT25. Click Open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the SCRNASEQ_VT25 project, you can create an RStudio (for Seurat/Bioconductor) or JupyterLab (for Scanpy) notebook server instance, depending on which toolkit you choose to work with, by clicking the Create button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will now see a form to configure a notebook server. Under Name put the name of your choice, e.g. the toolkit. Leave the rest of the fields unchanged. Now click Submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe notebook server will now be created for you. Wait a few minutes to see the status Running in green. You can now click on its name to open it in a new tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor JupyterLab you will need to use the password scrnaseq.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the status does not turn to Running within 5 minutes click on the three dots under Actions and then Delete. Wait a few minutes until you see the status Deleted. Now you can refresh the page and create a new instance starting from step 3.\nIn rare cases it may happen that your notebook server suddenly restarts. This could be due to an error that affected the notebook globally (for example, it ran out of temporary memory). You will see this on the page where you are working. A new notebook will start for you at the same URL within a few minutes.\n\n\nIn the case of both JupyterLab and RStudio you have access to persistent storage. This is mounted to the folder /home/jovyan/work. Files stored in this folder (NB: only in this folder) will be available even if a notebook suddenly restarts. You can also view, download these files or upload other files that will become visible in your instance through a File Manager that can be launched from the bottom of the Project overview page.\n\nInside the notebook server the script download-labs.sh is provided that will download the corresponding labs. It creates a labs folder with .qmd files (Seurat/Bioconductor) or .ipynb files (Scanpy). In the terminal, run any of the usage examples below:\n\n\nSeurat\n\nconda activate seurat\n~/download-labs.sh \"https://github.com/NBISweden\" \"workshop-scRNAseq\" \"compiled/labs\" \"seurat\" \"work/labs\"\n\nBioconductor\n\nconda activate seurat\n~/download-labs.sh \"https://github.com/NBISweden\" \"workshop-scRNAseq\" \"compiled/labs\" \"bioc\" \"work/labs\"\n\nScanpy\n\nconda activate scanpy\n~/work/download-labs.sh \"https://github.com/NBISweden\" \"workshop-scRNAseq\" \"compiled/labs\" \"scanpy\" \"work/labs\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemember that data is only saved inside the /home/jovyan/work folder. If you run the labs outside this folder, all the labs and data files will be lost in case the JupyterLab server restarts or gets deleted (this can happen e.g. if it runs out of memory). It is recommended that at the end of each session you save the notebooks locally. You can do this by dowloading them through the File Manager interface available at the bottom of the project dashboard.\n\n\n\nWhen you are done with a particular notebook server, you need to delete it before you can create a new one. Click on the three dots under Actions, and then click on Delete. Wait a few minutes until you see the status Deleted. Now you can refresh the page and start over."
